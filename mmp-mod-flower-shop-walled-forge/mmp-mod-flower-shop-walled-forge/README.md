# Flower Shop | Map Pack (Walled)

Flower Shop | Map Pack provides a detailed modern retail location perfect for investigations, social encounters, covert meetings, or unexpected trouble in an otherwise peaceful setting.

This pack includes a fully realized Flower Shop, featuring both the store interior and roof access, allowing scenes to unfold at street level or above the shop for surveillance, break-ins, rooftop escapes, or tense standoffs.

The interior is ideal for everyday commerce, secret backroom dealings, or quiet conversations among shelves of plants and floral arrangements, while the roof adds vertical gameplay options for modern campaigns, thrillers, or urban adventures.

Whether your story involves a seemingly innocent storefront, a hidden criminal connection, or a dramatic encounter in a tight urban space, Flower Shop | Map Pack offers a versatile and atmospheric location ready to drop into your game.

This version comes with complete line-of-sight setup, with walls, doors, and windows already placed.
